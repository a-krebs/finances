finances
======

This project has been mothballed.

Frankly, learning python and Django at the same time as
developing this resulted in more refactoring of
old poorly-written code than actual feature implementation.

This was a small Django project to do personal
small-scale bookkeeping and budgeting.

The primary goal was to learn the Django framework (along with
css and javascript), and to add some additional features over
the spreadsheet was using for managing my finances.
